/**
 * RankMoss "Custom website (direct)" receiver.
 *
 * RankMoss POSTs each approved guide here as signed JSON (no GitHub PR, no rebuild).
 * This endpoint verifies the HMAC-SHA256 signature over the RAW body, upserts the post
 * into Supabase (lib/rankmoss/supabaseStore.ts) keyed on its id, and replies 200 { url }.
 * A test ping verifies and replies 200 without publishing. The /<market>/guides/<slug>
 * route then renders it (filesystem first, this store as the fallback) at the same URL
 * the GitHub path produced.
 *
 * Receiver URL (set this as the endpoint in RankMoss Connections):
 *   https://portal.camel-global.com/api/rankmoss
 *
 * Env: RANKMOSS_SIGNING_SECRET (the secret RankMoss shows once on connect). The store
 * also uses the existing NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL + SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY.
 *
 * node:crypto needs the Node.js runtime; the body must not be cached or rewritten.
