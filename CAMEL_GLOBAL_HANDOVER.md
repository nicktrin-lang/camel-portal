Camel Global — Project Handover Document

This file is read directly by Claude Code from disk — you do NOT need to paste it.
At the start of a session, Claude reads `CLAUDE.md` in each repo (auto-loaded) plus the
"LATEST SESSION" section below. Update this file at the end of each session.

Working Rules
- Claude Code reads and edits files directly on disk (Read / Edit / Write). It does not
  work from pasted text or artifacts, so the old "paste the file / paste the file tree /
  write full files only / use sed / copy artifacts to disk" instructions no longer apply.
- Read the actual file before editing it — never trust a comment or this document as current.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` after every change. Commit per logical unit; deploy + verify per unit.
- Always git pull both repos before starting — a collaborator may have pushed.
- `main` requires a PR (pushes have used admin bypass). Confirm before pushing to production.
- When restyling, never touch API params or business logic — visual classes only.
- ChatWidget.tsx is NOT identical in both repos (portal = partner-focused welcome, customer =
  booking-focused). Footer.tsx also differs (portal has Portal/Driver/CustomerFooter, customer
  has CustomerFooter only). Update each separately.
- zsh globs `[id]` paths — single-quote dynamic route paths: 'app/partner/bookings/[id]/page.tsx'.
- Portal `lib/email.ts` is large — never replace it with a partial file. Restore if clobbered:
  `git show <commit>:lib/email.ts > lib/email.ts`.
- camel-coming-soon is a submodule and always shows modified — ignore it, never `git add` it;
  always `git add <specific-file>`, never `git add .`.

LATEST SESSION — 2026-07-23  (read this first)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## ✅ MERGED & LIVE this session (email audit + onboarding + recon)
- Email language audit (both repos) + follow-ups — MERGED. See the "DONE & LIVE — Full email
  LANGUAGE audit" block below. Partner backfill (9 rows) applied; customer signup now defaults
  locale from UI language.
- **Country canonicalisation for Stripe** — MERGED-pending on branch `claude/onboarding-country-aunz-9bc42f`
  (PR open). Map-click reverse geocoding returned local-language country ("España"); Stripe needs
  English ("Spain"). New `lib/portal/countryCanonical.ts` (all supported countries); geocode route
  requests `accept-language=en` + canonicalises; complete-signup / profile save / stripeCountry()
  canonicalise. Existing "España" partner rows backfilled to "Spain".
- **Payment/payout reconciliation audit** (read-only) — all invariants confirmed; job 1000174
  reconciles to the cent. 3 fixes MERGED (completion-email floor → stored values; commission-invoice
  single-currency guard + settled_at basis; report Stripe-fee bucket). Dead row 1000167 reconciled
  (settled €2.50, no money moved).

## 🚧 IN PROGRESS — AU/NZ Global Payouts (branch `claude/onboarding-country-aunz-9bc42f`, PR open)
- **DB schema for Chat 59 is ALREADY fully applied** (stripe_recipient_id, payout_rail, charge_model,
  outbound_payment_id/quote_id, stripe_fee_total/breakdown, partner_recovery_ledger). No migrations.
- **SDK GAP (important):** npm `stripe@22.1.1` does NOT expose the Global Payouts v2 preview APIs
  (recipient accounts / OutboundPayment). Decision: call the `/v2` REST API directly via HTTPS in an
  isolated helper (`lib/portal/stripeGlobalPayouts.ts`) — the SDK corridor path stays byte-untouched.
  API version header: `Stripe-Version: 2026-06-24.preview`.
- **PHASE 1 DONE (code):** connect route forks on AU/NZ → creates a v2 recipient
  (`configuration.recipient` + `capabilities.bank_accounts.local`), writes stripe_recipient_id +
  payout_rail='global_payouts', returns a Stripe-hosted onboarding link (Account Links v2). Completion
  webhook is `v2.core.account_link.returned`. Verified the request reaches `/v2/core/accounts`
  correctly; **local `sk_test` key is EXPIRED** — refresh it for full test-mode recipient creation.
- **STILL TO DO:** Phase 3 (OutboundPaymentQuote→OutboundPayment pipeline + decoupled-refund/ledger
  fork + the 6 outbound_payment webhooks), Phase 4 (cron AU/NZ branch), Phase 5 (finish fee reporting),
  Phase 6 (test-mode E2E → small real AU booking). Nick dashboard pre-work still required before live
  payouts: enable Local network payout method; set up recurring daily transfers. Kingsman (AU) is on
  payout_rail='connect' with a stale Connect account — Phase 1 is its reconnect path.

## ✅ DONE & LIVE — Stripe payment system rewrite (platform-hold model)

Both repos merged to `main` and deployed to production:
- Portal `main` = `3116b9c`  ·  Customer `main` = `e6dea37`
- Rollback tag on both repos: **`v-pre-stripe-rewrite`** (revert target if ever needed)

**Model** (replaces destination charges):
- Charge settles to Camel's **platform balance** — NO `transfer_data.destination`, NO
  `on_behalf_of`, NO `application_fee`. Metadata `charge_model="platform_hold"`.
- Partner paid **monthly** via explicit `stripe.transfers.create`, amount = stored
  `settled_partner_net`, **one transfer per (partner, currency, settlement-month)**.
- Commission stays on Camel's balance, per-currency. Camel bears all Stripe fees.
- Fuel: customer refunded unused fuel at **completion**; partner credited fuel used.
- Cancellation: **>48h = full refund** (booking `cancelled`); **<48h = fuel deposit
  refunded, partner keeps car hire** (booking `ready`, `settled_partner_net = car_hire − commission`).
- `settled_partner_net = car_hire − commission + fuel_used`, written at completion / <48h cancel.

**Validated end-to-end on the Stripe SANDBOX (real test money moved), all reconcile to the cent:**
P1 charge · P2 completion + €25 fuel refund (net €105) · P3 full refund (€150) + fuel-only
refund (€50, net €80) · P4 monthly payout (€105 transfer, invoice + statement, both tables `paid`).

**Bugs found & fixed this session:**
1. Completion failure was swallowed by `app/api/partner/bookings/[id]/update/route.ts` — now
   surfaces `settlement_error` + admin alert (money-critical, never silent).
2. Stripe connect threw on localized country names ("España") — added `COUNTRY_ALIASES` in
   `app/api/partner/stripe/connect/route.ts`.
3. Payout idempotency **poison**: key was `payout_<partner>_<period>_<ccy>`; a failed run
   cached the error for 24h and blocked retries. Now includes a sha1 of the booking-set.
4. `payout_batch_id` is a **uuid** column; cron wrote the Stripe `tr_...` string into it →
   22P02 → swallowed → split-brain (money sent, booking stuck `ready`). Added **`payout_transfer_id text`**
   column (bookings + payments); post-transfer DB failure now alerts admin, never swallowed.
5. End-of-month cutoff: payout/invoice/statement now tied to each booking's **`settled_at`
   month**, not the run date; current-open-month settlements defer to next run.

**DB migration already applied to prod (shared Supabase project):**
`ALTER TABLE partner_bookings ADD COLUMN payout_transfer_id text;` + same on `payments`.
(STRIPE_REWRITE_SCHEMA.sql already run in an earlier session.)

**Cleanup still pending (non-urgent):**
- Synthetic P3 test rows: `DELETE FROM payments WHERE booking_id IN ('11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111','33333333-3333-4333-8333-333333333333'); DELETE FROM partner_bookings WHERE job_number IN (1000180,1000181);`
- `ff60076` (outreach forwarded-email heuristic) shipped to prod with the portal merge — intentional, just noted.

**Deferred (separate builds, NOT blocking in-corridor EUR/GBP/USD/CAD launch):**
- **P5 AU/NZ Global Payouts** — Kingsman (AUD) is out-of-corridor. Needs v2 recipient objects +
  charge to platform balance + explicit OutboundPayment. Cron already branches on
  `payout_rail === "global_payouts"` and leaves those bookings `ready` (unpaid) for now.
- Optional: add `payout_transfer_id` to admin/partner CSV exports for reconciliation.

## ✅ DONE & LIVE — Full email LANGUAGE audit (partner + customer)  [2026-07-23]

MERGED to `main` and deployed to prod in both repos (portal PR #1, customer PR #1).
Follow-ups (branch `claude/email-followups-9bc42f`): customer signup now defaults
`communication_locale` from the signup UI language (customers have no country), and contact-form
auto-replies are now localized to the sender's site language (partner + customer). Admin contact
auto-reply stays English (internal).

**Root causes fixed:**
1. `partner/complete-signup/route.ts` — replaced es/en-only `deriveLocale` with shared
   `countryToEmailLocale()` (lib/email.ts: DE→de, FR→fr, IT→it, PT→pt, ES→es, else en) AND now
   **persists** it to `partner_profiles.communication_locale` (previously never written → every
   partner started null→en).
2. `partner/bookings/[id]/invoice-data/route.ts` — the `=== "es" ? "es" : "en"` fed the
   **PDF** (no email in this route); per the PDF-stays-English rule it now forces `locale="en"`.
3. Denia "German" traced: `getPartnerLocale` was correct; the `de` was stored on a Spain test
   partner ("Test Cars") set manually via settings. Data corrected by backfill.
4. **Backfill applied to prod (partners only):** 9 rows — 8 Spanish partners en→es, Test Cars
   de→es; AU/null-country partners correctly stayed en. `customer_profiles` has **no country
   column** so customers were left as-is (per decision).

**Localized (6 locales, all verified to differ from EN — 158 maps auto-checked):** booking
cancellation emails (admin/partner/customer routes, both repos), payout notification +
commission-invoice + monthly-statement **covering emails** (attached PDFs stay English),
partner suggestion-confirmation, partner + customer chat-transcript, partner + customer
password-reset (best-effort via generateLink's matched user). Already-correct senders
(make-live, update-status, resend-approval, bids, review/onboarding reminders, completeBooking,
post-refund, resend-statement, webhook receipt/confirm/partner) confirmed OK.

**Deliberate exceptions (documented):** contact-form auto-replies stay English (anonymous
submitters have no communication_locale and the form sends no locale); `partner/application-received`
alt route is unused (no callers — real signup email is localized in complete-signup).
All PDFs / commission invoice / monthly statement bodies stay English; `[Admin]` emails stay English.

---

## ⏭️ (superseded) NEXT TASK — Full email LANGUAGE audit (partner + customer)

**Symptoms observed:** Spanish partner (Denia Cars) — the application-received email was
Spanish (correct), but the "account is live" email arrived in **English** (should be Spanish).
A resent test booking produced a "new booking" email in **German** for a Spain-based partner.

**Requirement:** every transactional email to a partner or customer must be in the recipient's
language = their `communication_locale`, which **defaults to the language of their country** at
account creation and is **user-overridable** in account settings. All **6** locales (en, es, fr,
it, pt, de) must actually translate. **EXCEPT** the commission invoice, monthly statement, and
**every attached PDF** (receipt, completion statement, invoice-data, terms, operating rules) —
those stay **English** (NTUK legal). Internal `[Admin]` emails stay English.

**Root causes already identified (start here):**
1. **Country→locale default is es-or-en ONLY** — `app/api/partner/complete-signup/route.ts:42`:
   `c === "spain" || c === "españa" || c === "es" ? "es" : "en"` — a German/French/Italian/
   Portuguese partner never gets their language. Need a full COUNTRY→locale map (DE→de, FR→fr,
   IT→it, PT→pt, ES→es, else en) applied as the default `communication_locale` at creation.
2. **es-collapse ternary** (the exact CLAUDE.md-forbidden pattern) in a transactional email:
   `app/api/partner/bookings/[id]/invoice-data/route.ts:45` `communication_locale === "es" ? "es" : "en"`
   collapses de/fr/it/pt → English for the invoice-data *email*.
3. `communication_locale` may be **null/unset** for some accounts → `coerceEmailLocale` → 'en'.
4. **Inconsistent locale sourcing** across senders — some read `communication_locale`, some the
   application/browser locale, some hardcode. The German booking email comes from the customer
   webhook's `getPartnerLocale()` (`camel-customer/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`) — trace why
   it returned `de` for Denia.

**Audit scope — check EVERY email sender in both repos:**
- Portal senders: `app/api/admin/applications/{make-live,resend-approval,update-status}`,
  `app/api/admin/bookings/[id]/{cancel,post-refund,resend-statement}`,
  `app/api/partner/{bids,complete-signup,suggestions}`, `app/api/partner/bookings/[id]/{cancel,invoice-data,update}`,
  `app/api/cron/{onboarding-reminder,review-reminder}`, `app/cron/monthly-payout`,
  `lib/portal/completeBooking.tsx`, `lib/email.ts`.
- Customer senders: `app/api/test-booking/bookings/[id]/cancel`, `app/api/test-booking/requests`,
  `app/api/test-booking/customer-profile`, `app/api/webhooks/stripe`, `lib/email.ts`,
  `lib/portal/generateBookingReceiptPDF.tsx` (PDF must stay English — check the `locale === "es"`
  companyName fallback at line ~499).
- For each: resolve locale from `communication_locale` (defaulted by country); assert all 6
  languages actually DIFFER from the English source (a past bug left headings English while JSON
  shape validated); confirm PDFs/invoice/statement stay English.

Invoicing / VAT Architecture (CRITICAL — Chat 50)
Camel is marketplace intermediary. Partner is the supplier. Partner issues VAT invoices to customers.

Booking receipt: NOT a VAT invoice. Platform Payment Notice in PDF + email (EN/ES).
Commission invoice: monthly to partner. English only (NTUK legal).
Invoice Data PDF: data sheet for partner to raise their own invoice. EN/ES.
Documented in: partner terms clause 9, operating rules section 9b, customer terms clause 10b.

Chat Widget Architecture (CRITICAL)
ChatWidget.tsx exists in both repos but NOT identical. Both use key={locale} to force remount.

localeRef ensures current locale sent to API. ⚠️ Never use useLanguage() outside LanguageProvider.
Email Architecture (CRITICAL)
Rule: Notification emails = customer's language. PDF attachments = always English.
Partner emails (Chat 52)

Approval email: sent from noreply@camel-global.com, includes partner name greeting, 7 onboarding steps, orange CTA button, white logo
Approval email resend: manual button on admin approvals page (approved+not-live only)
Onboarding reminder: cron resends approval email every 48h until partner goes live
approval_email_last_sent_at stamped on every send to prevent duplicates

Admin notification emails (Chat 51)

New partner application → CAMEL_ADMIN_EMAILS — added to complete-signup/route.ts
Includes: company name, contact, email, phone, country, address, link to admin approvals

Adding a new language — FULL CHECKLIST (Chat 52)
To add e.g. "nl" (Dutch), update ALL of the following:
1. lib/i18n/LanguageContext.tsx

Add "nl" to: export type Locale = "en" | "es" | "fr" | "it" | "pt" | "de" | "nl"
Add detection: if (code.startsWith("nl")) return "nl";

2. lib/i18n/useTranslation.ts

Add: import nl from "./locales/nl.json";
Add to translations object: { en, es, fr, it, pt, de, nl }

3. Create locale file — run Claude API translation script:
bashcat > /tmp/translate_new_lang.py << 'ENDOFFILE'
import json, os, time, urllib.request

with open('/Users/nicktrinnaman/camel-portal/.env.local') as f:
    for line in f:
        if 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY' in line:
            key = line.strip().split('=',1)[1].strip('"').strip("'")

Partner Signup & Map Architecture (CRITICAL — Chat 51 fixes)
Lat/lng at signup

signup/page.tsx sends addressLat/addressLng (business) + baseLat/baseLng (fleet) to complete-signup route
complete-signup/route.ts saves: base_lat: baseLat ?? addressLat, base_lng: baseLng ?? addressLng
If partner doesn't set fleet address, business address coords used as fallback

Admin approvals map

Shows pending AND approved partners (not just approved)
Live partners sorted to render on top of not-live at same location
Green dot = live, orange dot = not live

Backfilling existing partners without coords
sqlUPDATE partner_profiles SET base_lat = {lat}, base_lng = {lng} WHERE company_name = '{name}';
Security Architecture (CRITICAL)
URL tamper protection — confirmed secure

Customer API: .eq("customer_user_id", customerUser.id) — 404 on mismatch
Partner API: .eq("partner_user_id", userId) unless adminMode — 404 on mismatch
Identity from verified JWT only

robots.txt — confirmed correct

Customer: allows public pages, blocks /bookings/, /account/, /reset-password/, /api/
Portal: allows /, /partner/signup, /partner/terms, /partner/privacy only
Test sites: block everything

CRITICAL: DB Client Rules
One Supabase project (guhcavvpuveiovspzxmg.supabase.co).

completeBooking.tsx uses direct REST fetch with NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL + SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY.

Future Work (Deferred)
🔲 Terms & Operating Rules PDF translations — FR, IT, PT, DE (Chat 53)

lib/portal/partnerTerms.ts — add PARTNER_TERMS_FR/IT/PT/DE arrays (copy PARTNER_TERMS_ES structure), update downloadPartnerTermsPDF() to accept full Locale type
lib/portal/operatingRules.ts — add OPERATING_RULES_FR/IT/PT/DE arrays, update downloadOperatingRulesPDF()
Use Claude API chunked translation script (same approach as Chat 52 locale files)
operating-rules page and partner account page call these — update locale param passing

🔲 Resend webhook signature verification — currently disabled (svix format mismatch). Add svix npm package and re-enable. Low risk as endpoint URL is obscure.

🔲 Server-side middleware auth gate — use Supabase official Next.js middleware helper. Test on staging first.

🔲 Commission invoice PDF — VAT number + 20% UK VAT once NTUK VAT registered

🔲 Xero monthly commission endpoint

🔲 DAC7 EU platform reporting

### Chat 53b — i18n follow-up (legal note, chat, mobile toggle)
Triggered by /partner/signup screenshot (4 issues). Tag: v-stable-chat53b-i18n-fixes.

1. **Legal note** — removed "reference only" wording from PARTNER_TERMS/OPERATING_RULES
   legalNote (es/fr/it/pt/de), keeping only the "English prevails" line. First attempt
   corrupted the live files via multibyte paste; repaired with a pure-ASCII (\u-escaped)
   re.subn that overwrites legalNote regardless of current content. Files:
   lib/portal/partnerTerms.ts, lib/portal/operatingRules.ts.
2. **Chat now FR/IT/PT/DE** — app/api/chat/route.ts: replaced the es-or-en ternary with a
   LANG_NAMES map + ${langName}, so the model is told to reply in the actual selected
   language. app/components/ChatWidget.tsx: broadened type Locale to all 6 and added
   FR/IT/PT/DE STRINGS (welcome/suggestions/buttons), fixed stray "?" in en welcome.
   PORTAL widget only — customer-repo ChatWidget stays EN/ES (correct).
3. **Mobile language switcher** — the 6-button inline CompactLanguageToggle overflowed
   (DE → "D"). Replaced with a compact "EN ▾" dropdown in app/partner/signup/page.tsx
   and app/HomePageContent.tsx.
4. **Signup/onboarding** confirmed already fully t()-wired; only removed a leftover
   `locale as "en"|"es"` cast in signup Step 5.

Delivery lessons (paste pipeline): multibyte UTF-8 corrupts in terminal paste — always
ship patches as pure-ASCII \u escapes. Even base64 long pastes can take a single homoglyph
substitution (an "F" became Cyrillic "Ф") — gzip+base64 halves the payload and hard-fails
on any corruption instead of writing garbage. Validate code edits with `npx tsc --noEmit`
against a faithful fixture, not just structural string checks: the chat STRINGS were first
inserted into the value *type* block instead of the value object because the brace-counter
anchored on the first `{` after `const STRINGS` (the type) rather than the `= {` value open.
Backups this round: .chat53c / .chat53d / .chat53e.<stamp>.bak.

~~Terms & Operating Rules PDF translations — FR, IT, PT, DE~~ ✅ Chat 53
~~Localize chat widget + mobile language switcher to FR/IT/PT/DE~~ ✅ Chat 53b

### Chat 53f — partner terms/rules headings were still English
The Chat 52/53 translation run translated clause/rule BODIES but left most section
HEADINGS (titles / section names) in English — its validator only checked JSON shape,
not that text changed. Pages and PDF were correct; the arrays were the problem.
Fix: re-translated only the 17 terms titles + 14 rules section names per language,
keeping every clause body byte-identical; new guard rejects any heading returned
identical to English and retries. Files: lib/portal/partnerTerms.ts, operatingRules.ts.
Backups .chat53f.<stamp>.bak. Lesson: when validating machine translation, assert the
output DIFFERS from the source, not just that it parses.

### Chat 53f/g — finishing portal i18n (terms/rules/account + settings)
Two root causes, both outside the files we kept editing:
1. **Uncommitted working-tree fixes.** app/partner/{terms,operating-rules,account}/page.tsx
   had the locale-aware RULES_BY_LOCALE/TERMS_BY_LOCALE edits applied on disk since Chat 53
   but NEVER committed — HEAD still had `locale === "es" ? _ES : _EN`, so production served
   English for FR/IT/PT/DE. Fix: commit + push the three pages. LESSON: disk-correct ≠
   deployed; check `git show HEAD:<file>` / the live DOM, not just the working copy.
2. **DB CHECK constraint.** partner_profiles.communication_locale_check only allowed
   ('en','es'); picking FR/IT/PT/DE on /partner/settings threw "violates check constraint".
   Fix (Supabase SQL): drop + re-add CHECK allowing en,es,fr,it,pt,de. customer_profiles
   still en,es by design (customer site is EN/ES). LESSON: widening UI language options
   needs matching DB constraint changes.
Section headings (Chat 53f): re-translated FR/IT/PT/DE titles/section-names; bodies
byte-identical. Verified live via browser (DE renders German end-to-end; settings save persists).
---

### Chat 53f/g - finishing portal i18n (terms/rules/account + settings) [Jun 26]
Two root causes, both OUTSIDE the files we kept editing:

1. Uncommitted working-tree fixes. app/partner/{terms,operating-rules,account}/page.tsx
   had the locale-aware TERMS_BY_LOCALE / RULES_BY_LOCALE edits applied on disk since
   Chat 53 but were NEVER committed - HEAD still had `locale === "es" ? _ES : _EN`, so
   production served English for FR/IT/PT/DE. Fix: committed + pushed the three pages.
   LESSON: disk-correct is NOT deployed. When a fix "isn't taking", check
   `git show HEAD:<file>` and/or the live DOM, not just the working copy.

2. DB CHECK constraint. partner_profiles_communication_locale_check only allowed
   ('en','es'); choosing FR/IT/PT/DE on /partner/settings threw
   "violates check constraint". Fix (Supabase SQL): dropped + re-added the CHECK to
   allow en,es,fr,it,pt,de. customer_profiles left at en,es by design (customer site
   is EN/ES). LESSON: widening UI language options needs a matching DB constraint change.

Section headings (Chat 53f): re-translated FR/IT/PT/DE section titles + names; clause/rule
bodies left byte-identical. Old translation run validated JSON shape but not that text
changed from English, so untranslated headings slipped through; new script rejects any
heading identical to source and retries.

Verified live via browser automation: /partner/operating-rules and /partner/account render
German end-to-end for DE; /partner/settings saves Deutsch and persists across reload with
no constraint error.

Delivery note: long pastes corrupt. Multibyte UTF-8 mangles in terminal paste (use \u
escapes / pure ASCII); even base64 took a homoglyph hit once and a dropped char once - gzip
+base64 shrinks payload and hard-fails on corruption. Backups this stretch: .chat53c/d/e/f.

### PLANNED (not started): Customer-site full localization FR/IT/PT/DE [scoped Jun 27]
(Customer-repo work, mirrored here for sync.) Customer site (camel-customer) is EN/ES only at
every layer. Goal: add fr,it,pt,de to match the portal's six locales (en,es,fr,it,pt,de).
EXCLUDED by decision: customer terms, privacy, cookie pages STAY ENGLISH - do not touch.
Switcher MUST work on mobile. PDFs STAY ENGLISH (NTUK legal doc) - replicate existing ES
behaviour (email localized, PDF English).

Do in PHASES, each its own commit + deploy + live-verify (lesson: disk-correct != deployed;
verify git show HEAD + live DOM). Translation rule: translate EVERYTHING, reject any value
byte-identical to English and retry (lesson: old runs left English in; validator only checked
shape). API key in .env.local (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY). Deliver patches pure-ASCII (\u escapes),
py_compile-gated, backups, tsc-checked. Heredocs: run direct, never wrap in outer cat<<EOF.

PHASE 1 - JSON: lib/i18n/locales/ has en.json + es.json (both 449 keys, 0 missing/extra).
  Generate fr/it/pt/de from en.json (all 449 keys), reject-English guard, verify parity on disk.
PHASE 2 - wiring + switcher (mobile):
  - lib/i18n/LanguageContext.tsx: type Locale (line 5) en|es -> 6; stored check (line 20) -> 6;
    detect de/fr/it/pt (line 30+); default stays "en".
  - lib/i18n/useTranslation.ts: import fr/it/pt/de json; translations registry (line 7) -> 6.
  - app/page.tsx CompactLanguageToggle (line 89, options line 91-93) -> 6 options; used
    desktop (line 430) AND mobile burger (line 467). Also stray hardcoded <option> at line 991
    (partner-marketing block) has en,es,it,fr,de but NO pt - fix to all 6.
  - Other switcher refs: lib/i18n/LanguageToggle.tsx, app/ClientRootLayout.tsx, app/account/page.tsx.
PHASE 3 - chat:
  - app/components/ChatWidget.tsx: type Locale (line 6) -> 6; STRINGS (en line 21, es line 39)
    add fr/it/pt/de; STRINGS[locale] ?? en already safe (line 87).
  - app/api/chat/route.ts: locale parse (line 50) es-or-en -> accept 6; systemPrompt (lines 142,181)
    replace `locale==="es"?"Spanish":"English"` with a langName map (same fix as portal route).
PHASE 4 - emails (PDF stays English):
  - lib/email.ts: brandEmail(headingEN,headingES,bodyEN,bodyES,locale) (line ~73) -> per-locale
    lookup w/ EN fallback; fns sendCustomerBidReceivedEmail (line 109), sendCustomerBookingCompletedEmail
    (line ~144), sendReviewReminderEmail (line ~183): widen locale union to 6, add fr/it/pt/de
    subject+body strings.
  - lib/portal/generateBookingReceiptPDF.tsx: email HTML subjectES/htmlES (lines 555-556) -> 6;
    PDF BODY STAYS ENGLISH (header note line 7). companyName ES fallback line 469/90.
  - Locale plumbing ALREADY EXISTS + WORKS: app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts has getCustomerLocale()
    (reads customer_profiles.communication_locale, lines 116-120) + getPartnerLocale (line 126),
    passes locale into sendBookingReceiptEmail (line 358), confirmed email (375), partner email (444).
    Currently collapses to ("es"?"es":"en") at lines 120/134 - widen these to return the real 6.
  - customer_profiles.communication_locale CHECK constraint is en,es ONLY - MUST widen to 6 via
    Supabase SQL before fr/it/pt/de can be saved (same fix as partner_profiles in portal Chat 53f).
  - Note: booking email routes live under app/api/test-booking/ AND app/api/webhooks/stripe/ -
    confirm which are live vs scaffolding before editing (webhook is live; receipt route too).
VERIFY each phase live via browser automation (Claude in Chrome) on www.camel-global.com,
incl. mobile viewport for the switcher. Backups: .loc / .chatwidget / .email per phase.
Stable rollback tag before this work: v-stable-customer-prelocalize (camel-customer).

### Chat 54 — Customer-site full localization FR/IT/PT/DE [Jun 27]
camel-customer brought from EN/ES to all 6 locales (en,es,fr,it,pt,de) to match the
portal. Customer terms/privacy/cookie pages stay ENGLISH (by decision). All PDFs stay
ENGLISH (NTUK legal) — email localized, PDF English, same as the existing ES behaviour.
Done in 4 phases, each its own commit + deploy + live-verify.

PHASE 1 — locale JSON: generated fr/it/pt/de from en.json via Claude API chunked script
  (50 keys/chunk, reject-English guard). Started 449 keys; +1 (nav.language) in phase 2 → 450.
  All 6 files 450/450, 0 missing/extra. Commit 169b993.
PHASE 2 — wiring + switcher: LanguageContext (Locale type → 6, browser detect, stored check),
  useTranslation (import+registry → 6), marketing/translations.ts (added pt block — it has its
  OWN Lang system separate from useTranslation; pt was missing from both the object AND the
  <option> list). Switcher: replaced the EN/ES CompactLanguageToggle with a portal-style
  six-box LanguageBoxes (compact prop) in BOTH app/page.tsx AND app/ClientRootLayout.tsx —
  the latter is the header on all logged-in pages (account/bookings) and was the reason
  logged-in users only saw EN/ES. Mobile burger uses a LANGUAGE-labelled box row like the
  portal. nav.language key added to all 6 locale files. Commits fa5ef3e, 55289f9, 622c7f4, 6d9832f.
PHASE 3 — chat: ChatWidget.tsx type Locale → 6 + fr/it/pt/de STRINGS blocks; api/chat/route.ts
  replaced es-or-en ternary with a langName map (model told the real language); ClientRootLayout
  ChatWidget locale cast widened. NOTE: chat bubble only renders when isCustomerLoggedIn — not
  a bug, by design. Commit (phase 3).
PHASE 4 — emails (PDF stays English): widened customer_profiles.communication_locale CHECK
  constraint en,es → en,es,fr,it,pt,de via Supabase SQL (GATING step — FR/IT/PT/DE cannot be
  saved without it; same fix as partner_profiles in Chat 53f). lib/email.ts brandEmail →
  map-based per-locale w/ EN fallback + SIG map; 3 customer emails (bid/completed/review) → 6.
  app/api/webhooks/stripe: getCustomerLocale/getPartnerLocale return real 6 (coerceLocale guard);
  inline brandEmail → map-based; customer-confirmed + partner-new-booking bodies → 6 via string
  maps with dynamic ${...} values preserved. generateBookingReceiptPDF.tsx: email subject/html/
  platform-notice → 6; PDF <Text> components UNTOUCHED (stay English). Commit a17f953.

Delivery lessons:
- Two SEPARATE EN/ES switchers existed (page.tsx + ClientRootLayout.tsx) — logged-out homepage
  vs logged-in pages. Fixing one isn't enough; the bug surfaced as "only EN/ES when logged in".
- marketing/translations.ts is a self-contained i18n island (Lang = keyof typeof translations,
  data-i18n attrs, setLanguage) — adding pt needed the translations object AND the <option>.
- Cross-file type chicken-and-egg: widening webhook's getCustomerLocale to return 6 broke its
  call into generateBookingReceiptPDF (still "en"|"es"). Each file's rewrite was correct alone
  but neither passed tsc in isolation — applied BOTH then tsc ONCE (shimmed npx to no-op so the
  per-file scripts wrote without self-restoring, then ran real tsc; restore both only on fail).
- API JSON-mode returns trailing prose after the } — strip via brace-matching extract, not
  whole-response json.loads.
- Translation bundles excluded 'es' (already on disk) — but EM_STRINGS maps need all 6;
  re-add es verbatim from existing code before building Record<Locale,...> literals.
- One straight-quote inside a value (translator used " not ") breaks the TS string — scan for
  inner straight-quotes before splicing; convert to curly to match house style.

Branch protection: main requires PRs; pushes used admin bypass ("Bypassed rule violations").

Remaining / verify:
- LIVE EMAIL TEST not yet done: set a test customer communication_locale='de', trigger a booking
  confirmation, confirm email arrives German + PDF English.
- Other logged-in pages with bespoke headers (bookings/[id], checkout) not individually audited —
  most inherit ClientRootLayout so should be covered; spot-check if EN/ES appears anywhere.

### Chat 55 — Full email localization + new-request partner alert + UI language fixes [Jun 27]
Two repos touched. Stable rollback tags: `v-stable-chat55` on BOTH camel-portal and camel-customer.

**Customer-repo UI fixes (camel-customer)**
- `app/account/page.tsx` — email-language picker was hardcoded EN/ES; now shows all 6
  (en,es,fr,it,pt,de) via an EMAIL_LANGS array + EmailLocale type. DB constraint was already
  widened to 6 in Chat 54, so this was pure UI.
- `app/checkout/[bid_id]/page.tsx` — checkout renders its OWN nav (the global header in
  ClientRootLayout is suppressed on /checkout via `!isCheckoutPage`), so it had NO language
  switcher. Added a CheckoutNav: desktop inline 6-box switcher + mobile burger dropdown with a
  LANGUAGE row, byte-matching the global LanguageBoxes style. Reads useLanguage() from the same
  LanguageProvider, so it drives whole-app locale. Logo kept non-link (no abandonment path mid-pay).

**New feature — partners alerted to new requests (camel-customer)**
- Symptom: customer posts a request, in-radius car-hire companies were never emailed to bid.
  There was NO partner-alert email anywhere in either repo — never built.
- `lib/email.ts` (customer) — added `sendPartnerNewRequestEmail(to, {jobNumber, vehicleCategory,
  pickupArea, expiresAt, locale})`, 6-locale + EN fallback, links to PORTAL /partner/requests,
  shows request#/vehicle/pickup area/"respond before" deadline (formatted per locale). Also
  exported `Locale` + `coerceLocale()` (were previously un-exported).
- `app/api/test-booking/requests/route.ts` — the geo+fleet match already existed (haversine vs
  base_lat/base_lng + service_radius_km, fleet category/capacity) and wrote request_partner_matches,
  but never emailed. Now:
    1. added communication_locale to the partner_profiles select;
    2. after the match loop, looks up partner_applications for the matched user_ids and keeps ONLY
       status==='live' (partner_applications.email is the contact address);
    3. the LIVE set drives BOTH the match-rows insert AND the emails — so non-live partners are
       neither matched nor emailed (BEHAVIOUR CHANGE: previously approved-not-live in-range partners
       got match rows; now they don't);
    4. emails the live set via Promise.allSettled (non-blocking — a mail failure never fails
       request creation). One email per partner (eligiblePartners map dedupes by user_id).
  - "Live" = partner_applications.status === 'live' (set by refreshPartnerLiveStatus / make-live).
  - GOTCHA: a live partner with null base_lat/base_lng or service_radius_km silently never matches
    (loop skips null coords). SQL to audit:
    SELECT pa.company_name, pa.status, pa.email, pp.communication_locale, pp.base_lat, pp.base_lng,
           pp.service_radius_km
    FROM partner_applications pa JOIN partner_profiles pp ON pp.user_id = pa.user_id
    WHERE pa.status = 'live';

**Full email localization — every notification now honours communication_locale (camel-portal)**
Root problem (same shape as the bid-email bug): locale lookups collapsed `de→en` via
`=== "es" ? "es" : "en"`, and several emails had NO fr/it/pt/de branch at all. Fixed across:
- `lib/email.ts` (portal) — brandEmail + all 7 senders widened to EmailLocale (6) with per-locale
  subject/heading/body maps + EN fallback. Exported `EmailLocale` type + `coerceEmailLocale()` for
  routes/crons to reuse. Default stays "en" so it's backward-compatible. "Meet & Greet Car Hire"
  tagline stays English (brand). Tag commit shipped first (fixed bid email — confirmed German).
- Locale lookups changed from the es/en collapse to `coerceEmailLocale(...)` (real 6, EN fallback) in:
  - app/api/partner/bids/route.ts (customer bid-received)
  - app/api/admin/applications/make-live/route.ts (account-live)
  - app/api/admin/applications/update-status/route.ts (approval + rejection)
  - app/api/admin/applications/resend-approval/route.ts (approval resend)
  - app/api/cron/onboarding-reminder/route.ts (approval reminder)
  - app/api/cron/review-reminder/route.ts (customer review reminder)
- Bespoke inline-HTML emails (had hardcoded es?ES:EN, no other langs) rewritten to 6-locale string
  maps with EN fallback; their attached PDFs STAY ENGLISH (NTUK rule):
  - lib/portal/completeBooking.tsx — customer + partner COMPLETION emails refactored into
    buildCustomerCompletionEmail / buildPartnerCompletionEmail; the 2 locale lookups (partner ~441,
    customer ~452) now coerceEmailLocale. Stripe transfer-reversal/refund + StatementDocument PDF
    UNCHANGED. Fuel level VALUES (fuelLabel/QUARTER_LABELS → "½ Tank") stay English in all locales
    (matches prior ES behaviour); only labels/prose localized.
  - app/api/admin/bookings/[id]/post-refund/route.ts — customer refund email → 6-locale; Stripe
    reversal/refund + cap check + amended PDF UNCHANGED.
  - app/api/admin/bookings/[id]/resend-statement/route.ts — customer statement email (normal +
    amended) → 6-locale; PDF UNCHANGED.
- DELIBERATELY left English: invoice-data/route.ts:45 (feeds the Invoice Data PDF, not an email —
  PDF stays English); all internal [Admin] notification emails (internal audience).

**Method / lessons this session**
- Every file delivered as a download + tsc-verified (standalone or stubbed) before deploy — incl.
  JSX stub-tsc for completeBooking.tsx and react-pdf/Stripe/Supabase stubs. Stub-induced false
  errors (e.g. db typed `any` → Map value `{}`, NextRequest missing .json) were confirmed by
  running the ORIGINAL file under the same stub.
- I cannot run the repo's Python translation script (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY only in user's .env.local),
  so the FR/IT/PT/DE email strings were written directly (finite set), placeholders/${...} preserved.
- macOS gotcha: `~/Downloads` had com.apple.macl/provenance xattrs → `cp`/`cat <` from Downloads
  hit "Operation not permitted"; `cat src > dest` TRUNCATES dest even when the read fails (clobbered
  lib/email.ts once — restored via `git checkout HEAD -- lib/email.ts`). Fix: grant terminal
  Downloads/Full-Disk access in System Settings, or drag files via Finder. Never paste a line
  starting with `#` into zsh (it errors and can eat the next command / leave a quote> prompt).

Stable tags: v-stable-chat55 (camel-portal AND camel-customer).

## Chat 55 — Email localization sweep + webhook hardening + UI language fixes [Jun 27 2026]
Stable rollback tag: `v-stable-chat55` on BOTH camel-portal and camel-customer.
(This block supersedes any earlier partial Chat 55 note — it includes the webhook work.)

### Shipped (camel-customer)
- **Account email-language picker → 6 locales.** `app/account/page.tsx` was hardcoded EN/ES;
  now shows all 6 (en,es,fr,it,pt,de). DB constraint already widened in Chat 54.
- **Checkout language switcher (was entirely missing).** `app/checkout/[bid_id]/page.tsx` — the
  global header is suppressed on /checkout (ClientRootLayout `!isCheckoutPage`), so checkout had
  no switcher. Added CheckoutNav: desktop inline 6-box + mobile burger dropdown, matching the
  global LanguageBoxes style, reading useLanguage() from the same provider. Logo kept non-link.
- **NEW: partners emailed on new requests.** Previously the geo+fleet match wrote
  request_partner_matches but never emailed anyone — the alert was never built.
  - `lib/email.ts` — added `sendPartnerNewRequestEmail(to,{jobNumber,vehicleCategory,pickupArea,
    expiresAt,locale})`, 6-locale, links to PORTAL /partner/requests. Exported `Locale`+`coerceLocale()`.
  - `app/api/test-booking/requests/route.ts` — after matching, looks up partner_applications for the
    matched user_ids and keeps ONLY status==='live'; the LIVE set now drives BOTH the match-rows
    insert AND the emails (Promise.allSettled, non-blocking).
  - BEHAVIOUR CHANGE: approved-but-not-live in-range partners no longer get match rows.
  - GOTCHA: a live partner with null base_lat/base_lng or service_radius_km silently never matches.

### Shipped (camel-portal) — full email localization
Root cause (same as the bid-email bug): locale lookups collapsed de→en via `=="es"?"es":"en"`, and
several emails had no fr/it/pt/de branch. Every notification now honours communication_locale across
6 locales (EN fallback). Attached PDFs STAY ENGLISH (NTUK rule).
- `lib/email.ts` — brandEmail + all 7 senders widened to EmailLocale(6) + per-locale maps. Exported
  `EmailLocale` + `coerceEmailLocale()`.
- Lookups switched to `coerceEmailLocale(...)` in: partner/bids, admin/applications/make-live,
  update-status, resend-approval, cron/onboarding-reminder, cron/review-reminder.
- Bespoke inline-HTML emails rewritten to 6-locale string maps (PDFs untouched):
  `lib/portal/completeBooking.tsx` (customer + partner completion — refactored into
  buildCustomerCompletionEmail/buildPartnerCompletionEmail; Stripe reversal/refund + StatementDocument
  PDF byte-identical); `admin/bookings/[id]/post-refund/route.ts` (customer refund email; Stripe +
  cap check + PDF unchanged); `admin/bookings/[id]/resend-statement/route.ts` (customer statement
  email, normal + amended; PDF unchanged).
- Deliberately English: invoice-data/route.ts (feeds Invoice Data PDF, not an email); all internal
  [Admin] notification emails. Fuel level VALUES (fuelLabel/QUARTER_LABELS → "½ Tank") stay English
  in all locales — only labels/prose localized.

### Shipped (camel-portal) — Resend webhook signature verification [DONE]
- `app/api/admin/outreach/webhook/route.ts` now verifies svix signatures (`svix` npm package added).
  Bad/missing signature → 401; processing errors still → 200 (no Resend retry storms).
- GOTCHA (this is what "format mismatch" was): RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET in Vercel must be the EXACT
  Resend signing secret INCLUDING the `whsec_` prefix — no quotes, no trailing newline. A wrong/
  missing prefix makes svix throw "Base64Coder: incorrect characters for decoding", every event 401s,
  and open/click tracking silently stops. Env var changes require a redeploy. Verified working
  (live click incremented the count) after correcting the secret.

### Method / lessons
- Every file delivered as a download + tsc-verified (standalone or stubbed) before deploy. Stub-
  induced false errors (db typed `any`; NextRequest missing .json) confirmed by running the ORIGINAL
  file under the same stub.
- FR/IT/PT/DE email strings written directly (can't run the repo's translation script — ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  is only in the user's .env.local).
- macOS: `~/Downloads` had com.apple.macl/provenance xattrs → cp/cat-from-Downloads = "Operation not
  permitted"; `cat src > dest` TRUNCATES dest even when the read fails (clobbered lib/email.ts once;
  restored via `git checkout HEAD -- lib/email.ts`). Fix: grant terminal Downloads/Full-Disk access,
  or drag via Finder. Never paste a line starting with `#` into zsh.

## OUTSTANDING — to do (Chat 56+)

### A. Verification / live tests (do soon — code is shipped, real-world send not yet confirmed)
- [ ] **Live German email test.** Set a test customer communication_locale='de', trigger a booking
      confirmation + a completion; confirm emails arrive in German with English PDFs. Now broad —
      the whole email surface was localized this session. Clicks track more reliably than opens.
- [ ] **Partner new-request alert — live test.** Confirm a live, in-radius partner actually receives
      "New booking request in your area". Run the null-coords audit first:
      SELECT pa.company_name, pa.status, pa.email, pp.communication_locale, pp.base_lat, pp.base_lng,
             pp.service_radius_km
      FROM partner_applications pa JOIN partner_profiles pp ON pp.user_id = pa.user_id
      WHERE pa.status='live';
- [ ] **bookings/[id] language switcher** spot-check (checkout was fixed this session; this page has a
      bespoke header and wasn't individually audited for EN/ES leaks).

### B. Deferred technical work
- [ ] **Server-side middleware auth gate.** middleware.ts is still pass-through (NextResponse.next()).
      DECISION: defence-in-depth only — data is already protected at the API layer (verified JWT +
      .eq ownership scoping). Riskier change (session/cookie handling); test on staging. Low priority.
- [ ] **Commission invoice VAT.** Add VAT number + 20% UK VAT to the commission invoice PDF once NTUK
      is VAT-registered.
- [ ] **Xero monthly commission endpoint** — not built.

### C. US market launch (currently "ready-but-not-activated" — real gaps below)
Handover frames US as a future market: USD is wired through the currency system, Stripe Connect
country map includes US — but the platform is built UK/NTUK + EU/Spain-shaped. None of the below is
a code blocker today; they are the work a real US launch would require. NOTE: tax/legal items here
need confirmation with a US tax/legal professional — they are flagged as areas to address, not advice.
- [ ] **Sales tax vs VAT.** The entire invoicing/commission architecture assumes UK VAT (and EU/Spain).
      The US has no VAT — it uses state/local sales tax with nexus rules. A US launch needs a US
      sales-tax model (likely a tax provider e.g. Stripe Tax / Avalara), not the VAT path.
- [ ] **Partner tax reporting: DAC7 → 1099-K.** DAC7 (the deferred EU platform-reporting item) is
      EU-specific. A US launch would instead need IRS 1099-K reporting for partner payouts, plus
      W-9/TIN collection at partner onboarding. Different system entirely.
- [ ] **Legal pages / locale.** Customer legal pages (terms, privacy) are EN/ES-only by design. US
      needs US-English content and US-specific terms/privacy (e.g. CCPA/state privacy), reviewed by
      counsel. Operating Rules / Terms PDFs would need a US variant.
- [ ] **USD end-to-end validation.** USD is wired and Stripe Connect lists US, but the full customer
      pay → partner payout (USD) path has not been live-tested. Validate before any US pilot.
- [ ] **Entity / banking / Stripe.** NTUK is a UK company. Confirm whether US operations need a US
      entity, US tax registration, and Stripe Connect onboarding for US-based partners (US bank
      accounts, SSN/EIN). Finance/legal task, not engineering.
- [ ] **i18n / formatting.** US date/number/address formats, US phone validation, and US-English copy
      (vs en-GB) where the UI currently assumes UK/EU conventions.

### Reference: removed from Future Work this session (done)
- Terms & Operating Rules PDF translations FR/IT/PT/DE — DONE.
- Resend webhook signature verification — DONE (this session).

# Handover — Chat 56

Continues from the Chat 55 handover. Two repos: **camel-portal** (partner/admin/driver portal) and **camel-customer** (customer booking site). Both Next.js, Supabase, Stripe Connect, 6-locale i18n (en/es/fr/it/pt/de).

Stable tags: `v-stable-chat55` (start of this session). Recommend tagging `v-stable-chat56` at the end (see rollback doc).

---

## What shipped this session

### 1. Mobile language-switcher consistency (portal)
All portal auth/marketing surfaces now use ONE pattern: desktop inline switcher (`lg+`), mobile **hamburger** whose dropdown holds a six-box LANGUAGE row (`t("settings.language.label")` + `flex-1 / py-2.5` active-orange), matching the driver authenticated header.
- Homepage, partner login, partner reset-password, partner signup, driver public header (login/signup/reset via `app/driver/layout.tsx`).
- Root cause fixed along the way: `LanguageToggle.tsx` has **no** `hidden lg:flex` (handover-55 note was wrong) — it renders at all breakpoints, which caused a double-up when a second mobile row was added. Fix = wrap inline toggle in `hidden lg:*` + single mobile treatment.

### 2. Stripe connect hardening (portal) — `71bfb3a` + `7cc88c9`
`app/api/partner/stripe/connect/route.ts`:
- `stripeCountry()` now **throws** on an unrecognised `base_country` instead of `|| "ES"`. The old silent Spain default created wrong-country Stripe accounts (a connected account's country is **locked at creation**), which is exactly what broke the Australian partner.
- Account settlement currency is **country-derived** (`COUNTRY_CURRENCY[countryCode]`), not the partner's display currency.
- On account creation, writes `default_currency = settlement currency` (uppercased) back to `partner_profiles` → **Stripe is the single source of truth** for partner currency.

### 3. Multi-currency rollout: AUD / NZD / CAD (both repos) — Phases 0–4
Added Australian Dollar, NZ Dollar, Canadian Dollar to the existing EUR/GBP/USD system. **Key architecture (confirmed with the code, corrects a stale comment):** the system is **bid-currency, NO FX** — the partner's currency (= their Stripe settlement currency, country-derived, read-only) is what they bid in, what the customer is charged, and what they're paid out. The `useCurrency`/rate layer is only a **secondary browse-display** aid, never the transactional path.

- **Phase 0 (foundation):** `lib/currency.ts` widened to 6; new shared exports `CURRENCIES`, `currencyLocale()`, `currencySymbol()`, `coerceCurrency()`, `isCurrency()`, `formatMoney()`. `lib/useCurrency.ts`, `app/api/currency/rate/route.ts`, and customer `lib/serverCurrency.ts` all handle 6. Rate route fetches AUD/NZD/CAD from frankfurter.app.
- **Phase 1 (coercion points):** every place that narrowed currency to EUR/GBP(/USD) now uses `coerceCurrency()` — portal `bids/route.ts`, `partner/requests/[id]`, `admin/accounts/[id]`; customer `create-intent`, `book/page.tsx`, `test-booking/{requests,bids/accept,requests/[id]}`. This is what lets an AUD bid be stored and charged as AUD.
- **Phase 2 (reporting/CSV):** the 4 reporting pages (`admin/bookings`, `admin/reports`, `partner/bookings`, `partner/reports`) iterate `CURRENCIES` instead of `["EUR","GBP","USD"]`; per-currency accumulators built dynamically from `CURRENCIES`. AUD/NZD/CAD now appear in breakdowns, filters, and CSV summary rows.
- **Phase 3 (read-only currency UI):** partner currency is Stripe-derived & locked. `partner/profile/page.tsx` shows all 6 correctly (was falling through to "Euro"). Onboarding `StepCurrency` is now **informational** (no picker, no DB write) — reused `onboarding.currency.*` keys, retext'd in all 6 locales, explaining currency is set at the Stripe payout step.
- **Phase 4 (formatting polish):** replaced the repeated `GBP→en-GB, USD→en-US, else es-ES` ternaries / 3-key locale maps with the shared `currencyLocale()` across booking-detail pages, PDFs, refund/statement routes, webhook. AUD/NZD/CAD now format natively (A$/NZ$/C$ with correct grouping).
- **Phase 5 (verification):** end-to-end tested by flipping test booking `1000167` through AUD→NZD→CAD and confirming bookings/reports/CSV/detail render correctly, then restored to EUR. **Passed.** (Data-only test, no live charge.)

The **€10 minimum-commission floor** (stored EUR) now converts to bid currency via a fixed `MIN_FLOOR_RATE` map in `create-intent` (approximate rates: AUD 1.63, NZD 1.78, CAD 1.47).

### 4. Australia city list + generic tax wording (portal) — `19a971a`
- Portal `lib/cities.ts` was stale (Spain/UK/FR/IT/DE/PT only). Replaced with the customer repo's fuller list — now includes **Australia** (7 cities), Netherlands, Ireland, expanded US/UK/Greece, UAE. Fixes AU partners being unable to find their city at signup.
- Genericized Spain-specific tax strings site-wide across all 6 locales: **"VAT / NIF" → "VAT / Tax number"** (localized per language), removed the "Spanish companies use a NIF… ESB12345678" hint/placeholder, softened the eligibility line. No new translation keys.

---

## Current currency model (important for future work)

- **One currency per partner = their Stripe account settlement currency** (country-derived at Stripe onboarding, written to `partner_profiles.default_currency`, **read-only** everywhere).
- **Bid currency = charge currency = payout currency = settlement currency.** No FX on the transactional path.
- Each bid/booking **snapshots** its currency at creation (`partner_bids.currency`, `partner_bookings.currency`) — history is immutable; changing a profile currency never rewrites past rows.
- Multi-currency-per-partner is deliberately **out of scope** (would require multiple Stripe accounts and reintroduce FX).
- Supported set is defined once in `lib/currency.ts` `CURRENCIES`. Adding a 7th currency = add it there + its `COUNTRY_MAP`/`COUNTRY_CURRENCY` entry in the connect route + a `MIN_FLOOR_RATE` entry + a rate in the rate route/`serverCurrency`. The shared helpers mean most consumers pick it up automatically.

---

> **SUPERSEDED by Chat 59 (Jul 8 2026).** The 0.25% cross-border fee below is WRONG for AU/NZ (real: AU ~1-3%, NZ ~0.5-2.5% depending on FX). See the Chat 59 Global Payouts section for corrected fees, all answered Stripe questions, and the full build plan.

## Stripe corridor reality (the AU/NZ payout blocker)

- Your UK platform uses **destination charges** (customer pays → funds auto-transfer to partner's connected account). This works **in-corridor only**: US, UK, EEA, **Canada**, Switzerland.
- **CAD is fully live** — Canada is in-corridor, no extra Stripe setup.
- **AU / NZ are OUT of corridor.** Cross-border transfers don't reach them, and recipient-service-agreement accounts can't receive cross-border transfers either. Confirmed by Stripe live chat.
- **The solution is Global Payouts** — a separate rail: funds land in the platform balance, then you explicitly send an outbound payment to the AU/NZ partner as a "recipient" (their bank details, per-payout FX quote, 0.25%+ fee). It is **limited public preview**, **Sales-gated** (not self-serve), verification takes a few business days.
- **Status:** email sent to Stripe Sales requesting Global Payouts access for AU/NZ (see the 5 questions below). **Nothing to build until they reply** — Q2 (reuse Connect accounts vs. separate recipients) and Q5 (destination-charge vs. separate-charge-plus-outbound) determine the whole shape of the build.

Questions pending with Stripe Sales:
1. Enable Global Payouts for UK platform, AU/NZ recipients — eligibility/timeline.
2. Reuse existing Connect accounts as recipients, or create separate Global Payouts recipient objects?
3. Exact recipient onboarding data required (bank/routing, address, business type)?
4. Available payout methods for AU/NZ (local bank vs card)?
5. Works with destination charges, or requires separate charges + explicit outbound payment per booking? FX/fee/settlement mechanics?

## Kingsman Chauffeur Services (the AU partner) — state

- `user_id = 116fd343-a034-4153-ac33-34bf1fcd7153`
- Old **Spanish** Stripe account `acct_1TmAtY96UBUllKs9` was created by the pre-fix silent-ES default → couldn't attach an AU bank (country locked). **Deleted in Stripe.**
- Profile now primed for a clean AU reconnect: `base_country = Australia`, `default_currency = AUD`, `stripe_account_id = NULL`.
- **Next:** partner reconnects via portal ("Connect Stripe") → route mints a fresh **AU** account (AUD settlement) → he can add his Australian bank and complete onboarding. Reconnect email drafted/sent.
- **Payout still blocked** until Global Payouts is enabled (above). Onboarding completes; live payout follows Stripe approval.

---

## Outstanding / to-do

**Blocking on Stripe (no code until they reply):**
- Global Payouts approval for AU/NZ → then build the AU/NZ payout path (likely: separate charge to platform balance + recipient creation + per-booking outbound payment + reconcile against existing `payout_status`/`payout_batch_id` columns). Scope as its own phased project.

**Carried over from Chat 55 (still open):**
- Live German-email test (set a test customer `communication_locale='de'`, trigger booking confirmation + completion, verify German email + English PDF).
- Partner new-request alert live test — run null-coords audit SQL first (live partners with null `base_lat`/`base_lng`/`service_radius_km` silently never match), then confirm a live in-radius partner receives the alert.
- `bookings/[id]` language-switcher spot-check (bespoke header, never audited for EN/ES leaks).
- Server-side middleware auth gate (`middleware.ts` still pass-through; defence-in-depth, low priority).
- Commission invoice VAT (blocked on NTUK VAT registration); Xero monthly commission endpoint (not built).
- US-market launch items (sales tax vs VAT, 1099-K/W-9, US legal pages, USD end-to-end, entity/banking) — need a US professional.

**Housekeeping:**
- `.bak` files piling up in both repos (`*.chat5*.bak`) — clutter `git status`. Sweep them out or add `*.bak` to `.gitignore` when convenient.
- `git` shows `camel-coming-soon` submodule always modified — ignore it, never `git add` it.

---

## Working-agreement notes (carried forward + reinforced this session)

- **Always check the actual file before rewriting** — never assume the artifact/comment is current. (Two stale-comment traps this session: the `LanguageToggle` "hidden lg:flex" note, and the `currency.ts` "all prices in EUR" comment — both wrong; the code was truth.)
- **Deliver as downloads or `python3 << 'PYEOF'` heredocs**, not pasted scripts. Browser downloads to `~/Downloads` sometimes don't land — heredocs are the reliable path. Never paste raw multi-line scripts into zsh (garbled / `event not found`).
- **zsh globs `[id]` paths** — always single-quote paths containing `[...]` in `git add`, `cat`, `sed`, etc. This bit us repeatedly.
- **Patch scripts must back up + assert + abort on mismatch** (never silent no-op). Validate against a faithful fixture when the file's too big to eyeball.
- **`tsc --noEmit` after every change; commit per logical unit.** Widening a shared type surfaces every hardcoded consumer — use tsc as the checklist.
- **Terminal command output frequently pasted back empty this session** — screenshots came through reliably. If a paste is blank, screenshot the terminal.
- Git commits show a "committer name/email not configured" notice — harmless; commits succeed. (Optionally `git config --global user.name/user.email` to silence.)

## Chat 57 — Revert recovery + outreach conversion diagnosis + signup banner [Jul 4 2026]

Stable tag: `v-stable-chat57` (camel-portal). Most of this session was (1) recovering an accidental
revert of the entire Chat 56 portal session, and (2) diagnosing why partner outreach converts poorly
and shipping a fix to the signup page. camel-customer was NOT affected by the revert and was not
changed this session (still at `v-stable-chat56`).

### 1. Accidental revert of all Chat 56 work — RECOVERED
- Symptom: after asking a previous chat for a "safe rollback + handover update", `git log` showed a
  stack of 13 `Revert "..."` commits on `origin/main` (all authored 22:06 same batch) that had backed
  out EVERY Chat 56 portal commit — the 6-currency phases (0–4), Stripe connect hardening, AU city
  list, and the mobile language-switcher work. `grep` confirmed the code was gone from disk
  (`CURRENCIES`=0, `COUNTRY_CURRENCY`=0). This was NOT intentional — a "rollback" request had been
  executed as `git revert` of the commits rather than a tag.
- Recovery: identified last good commit `19a971a` (end-of-Chat-56, "Add Australia + fuller city
  list…"). Tagged the broken tip as `backup-before-restore-chat56` (safety net), then
  `git reset --hard 19a971a`, cherry-picked back the one legit post-revert commit (the `.gitignore`
  `*.bak` change `5c0da15`), verified code was restored on disk (`CURRENCIES`=3 etc.), then
  `git push --force-with-lease origin main`. Re-tagged `v-stable-chat56` properly.
- **Vercel gotcha (important):** even after `main` was fixed, the live site still served the OLD
  reverted build because Vercel had auto-promoted a *revert* commit to Production. Git being correct
  does NOT mean production is correct. Fix: promote the correct deployment (`19a971a`) in the Vercel
  dashboard. LESSON: after any history recovery, check the Vercel **Production badge is on a good
  commit**, not just that git/`main` is right.
- **LESSON (headline):** a "safe rollback" means create a `git tag` (changes nothing) — NEVER
  `git revert` the commits (backs out working code). A tag is a bookmark; a revert is a deletion.

### 2. Outreach conversion diagnosis (GA4)
Outreach was ~616 sent, ~207 opens (34%), ~36 clicks, but only 2 signups. Investigated the whole
funnel:
- **List is clean.** `SELECT country, COUNT(*) FROM outreach_prospects GROUP BY country` = 1,449
  Spain, 1 UK. The "opens from Netherlands/Ireland" the user worried about are Apple Mail Privacy /
  corporate-scanner PROXY opens (they geolocate to Irish/Dutch datacentres), not real non-Spanish
  companies. Email open/click geo is unreliable for this reason; click counts are also inflated by
  proxy pre-fetch, so real human clicks < 36.
- **The drop is click → signup-form, not form abandonment.** GA4 funnel showed `/partner/signup`
  reached by only ~4 users over 90 days with **~4–9 second** engagement (a bounce), and
  `/partner/application-submitted` ~2–3 users (= the 2 real signups). The homepage (`/`) gets real
  prospect traffic (33s engagement) and tells the story well — but Step 1 of signup was a cold,
  context-free form that killed the momentum.
- **Open lead for next session:** `/partner/login` was getting ~3.5× MORE outreach traffic than
  `/partner/signup` (35 vs 10 views). New prospects shouldn't be hitting login — they have no
  account. Likely CTA ambiguity (homepage "Partner login" button next to "Apply", or email wording).
  Worth investigating — could be an easy conversion win.

### 3. GA4 saved-report gotcha (for future analytics work)
- Temporary filters in standard **Reports** (the filter chip) do NOT persist on save — GA4 clears
  them; only report structure (dimensions/metrics/date) saves. To keep a filtered view: use a
  **Comparison** (persists in Reports, shows alongside All Users) OR build it in **Explore**
  (filters persist fully — preferred).
- Built a permanent Explore exploration named **"Outreach Journey"** (Free-form): rows = Page path,
  values = Views + Avg engagement time, filters = `Session campaign exactly matches founding-partner`
  AND `Page path does not match regex .*(admin|driver|/partner/(dashboard|bookings|requests|reports|
  drivers|fleet|profile|settings|account|onboarding)).*`. Reopen after each batch to see the clean
  prospect funnel. NOTE on the regex: anchored `/(admin|driver)` did NOT reliably match; the
  `.*(...).* ` form does.
- **Internal Traffic filter:** created in Chat 52 but check it's set to **Active**, not **Testing**
  (Admin → Data settings → Data filters). In Testing it does nothing. It is not retroactive. (This is
  why the user's own traffic still appeared in older reports.) For outreach analysis it barely matters
  — filter by `session campaign = founding-partner`; you don't click your own outreach emails
  (except the test prospects nicktrin+101/+102, which DO pollute the campaign bucket — hence the
  page-path exclusion above).

### 4. Signup Step 1 fix — founding-partner banner (SHIPPED)
Root cause of the 4-second signup bounce: the excellent, story-rich homepage handed prospects to a
naked Step-1 form with zero reinforcement of the pitch. Fix = a bold reassurance banner.
- `app/partner/signup/page.tsx`: widened both `max-w-2xl` containers (header + card) to `max-w-4xl`;
  inserted a full-width **orange banner at the TOP of the card, above the ProgressBar** (so it shows
  on ALL 5 steps by design — reinforces free/quick throughout). Banner = "FOUNDING PARTNER INVITATION"
  label + three white cards: **FREE TO JOIN** / No monthly fees, ever · **5 MINUTES** / Quick and
  simple to apply · **MORE BOOKINGS** / Alongside your existing business.
- Deliberately DROPPED from earlier drafts (per user, marketing calls): commission % (it's a negative
  — don't advertise your cut), "100% fuel to you" (confusing to a cold reader), and any Spain
  reference (keeps it universal / non-dating). No € shown.
- i18n: reused/rewrote `signup.step1.reassure.*` keys (founding, stat1–3, sub1–3) across all 6
  locales (en/es/fr/it/pt/de). No logic, validation, GA tracking, or API touched — copy + layout only.
- Delivery method: pure-ASCII `python3 << 'PYEOF'` heredocs (backup + anchor-count assert + abort on
  mismatch), `npx tsc --noEmit` clean before each deploy. Backups `.chat57*.bak` (swept at end).

### To measure whether it worked
Reopen the "Outreach Journey" Explore after the next send batch and watch:
- `/partner/signup` **avg engagement time** — was ~4s; should climb if the banner reduces the bounce.
- `/partner/application-submitted` **count** — the real success metric (was ~2). Small numbers — give
  it a batch or two before judging.

### Housekeeping done this session
- `.bak` sweep + `*.bak` added to `.gitignore` (both repos) — early in session.
- Handover `.md` committed to both repos (Chat 56 section had been uncommitted on disk).
- `v-stable-chat56` tagged on BOTH repos (was missing); `v-stable-chat57` on camel-portal.
- Safety tag `backup-before-restore-chat56` still on the old broken portal tip — deletable once
  confident (`git tag -d backup-before-restore-chat56`, local only, never pushed).

### Still open / next session
- **Investigate `/partner/login` >> `/partner/signup` outreach traffic** (CTA ambiguity — likely
  quick win).
- Carried from Chat 56: Stripe Global Payouts for AU/NZ (blocked on Stripe Sales reply); live
  German-email test; partner new-request alert live test (run null-coords audit SQL first);
  `bookings/[id]` language-switcher spot-check; middleware auth gate; commission-invoice VAT; Xero
  endpoint; US-market items.

## Chat 57 — Signup banner, outreach diagnosis, LinkedIn, ENUM INCIDENT, vehicle preferences [Jul 4–5 2026]

Long session. Started by recovering the Chat 56 accidental revert (see top of Chat 56 note — 13
reverts wiped the portal session; recovered via `reset --hard 19a971a` + cherry-pick + force-with-lease;
production had to be manually promoted off a revert build in Vercel). Then: signup conversion work,
an outreach funnel diagnosis, a LinkedIn playbook, a self-inflicted DB enum incident (fully reverted),
and a new **vehicle-preferences** feature (transmission + child seats) that is ~60% shipped.

Stable tags at session start: `v-stable-chat56` (both repos). **Recommend tagging `v-stable-chat57`
on BOTH repos at the start of next chat**, once the enum note below is understood.

---

### WARNING 1. ENUM INCIDENT — READ THIS FIRST (fully reverted, but leaves one inert artefact)
**What happened:** while debugging why a new test booking (#1000172) matched no partner, I mis-read the
customer match loop's `partner_applications.status === "live"` check and wrongly concluded the
`partner_application_status` enum was "missing" a `live` value. I ran
`ALTER TYPE partner_application_status ADD VALUE 'live';` and set Test Cars to `status='live'`.
**This broke the partner account** (it showed the "application is being reviewed" screen) and made the
admin show a "Live" badge *under status* that was never there.

**The CORRECT model (confirmed by the user):** `partner_applications.status` is ONLY
`pending` / `approved` / `rejected`. A partner works/matches when **`approved`**. "Live" is a SEPARATE
**computed** concept — the admin "Live" badge is derived on the fly from the 7 live-checks
(`refreshPartnerLiveStatus`), NOT stored in `status`. Do not put `live` in `status`.

**Reverted:** `UPDATE partner_applications SET status='approved' WHERE user_id='0de564d5-8871-4530-bb29-0f7b2f26c422';`
Test Cars is back to `approved` and works again. Confirmed no other row has `status='live'`.

**Residual (harmless):** the enum still has an inert unused `live` label. Postgres can't easily drop an
enum value (needs type recreation + column re-point — risky, zero benefit). **Left in place, unused.**
Do NOT write `status='live'` anywhere.

**OPEN QUESTION for next chat (do NOT change code without checking):** the customer match loop in
`camel-customer/app/api/test-booking/requests/route.ts` (~line 200) filters matched partners to those
where `partner_applications.status === "live"`. Given the correct model is `approved`, this line looks
WRONG — it would match zero partners. YET the user says matching worked the day before, and request
#1000173 DID match Test Cars *while Test Cars was temporarily `live`*. So either (a) the loop really does
require `live` and real partners are silently never matching (a latent production bug), or (b) I mis-read
it again. **Next chat: read that match-loop status check verbatim, and reconcile with make-live /
refreshPartnerLiveStatus which both try to write `status='live'` (portal:
app/api/admin/applications/make-live/route.ts line ~102, lib/portal/refreshPartnerLiveStatus.ts line ~116).**
If those writes were failing silently on the enum before I added the value, that's a real bug to fix
properly (likely: the whole "live" concept should be a boolean/computed flag, and the match loop should
check `approved` + the live-checks — NOT a `status='live'` value). Treat as a genuine investigation, not
a quick patch — it's core matching logic.

---

### 2. Signup founding-partner banner (SHIPPED, camel-portal)
Diagnosed via GA4 that outreach clickers hit `/partner/signup` and bounced in ~4s off a cold form.
Added a bold orange banner at the TOP of the signup card (above the ProgressBar, shows on all 5 steps):
"FOUNDING PARTNER INVITATION" + 3 white cards **FREE TO JOIN / 5 MINUTES / MORE BOOKINGS**. Widened card
to `max-w-4xl`. No commission %, no fuel, no Spain refs (user's marketing calls). File:
`app/partner/signup/page.tsx` + `signup.step1.reassure.*` keys in all 6 portal locales.

### 3. Outreach funnel diagnosis (GA4) — findings
- Prospect list is CLEAN: `SELECT country,COUNT(*) FROM outreach_prospects` = 1,449 Spain, 1 UK. The
  "opens from NL/Ireland" are Apple-Mail-Privacy / datacentre PROXY fetches (Dublin=AWS, Amsterdam=Azure),
  NOT real non-Spanish companies. Email opens/clicks are bot-inflated; judge by bottom-of-funnel only.
- Live burst of "4-6 active users from Dublin/Amsterdam" seconds after each send = mail-scanner
  pre-fetches, not humans. Real prospects trickle in over hours with real engagement time.
- **Built a permanent GA4 Explore named "Outreach Journey"** (Free-form): rows=Page path,
  values=Views+Avg engagement time, filters = `Session campaign exactly = founding-partner` AND
  `Page path does not match regex .*(admin|driver|/partner/(dashboard|bookings|requests|reports|drivers|
  fleet|profile|settings|account|onboarding)).*`. Reopen after each batch.
- **GA4 gotcha (recorded):** temporary filters in standard *Reports* do NOT persist on save — GA4 clears
  them. Use **Explore** (persists) or a Comparison. Also: Internal Traffic data filter may be in "Testing"
  (does nothing) — check Admin>Data settings>Data filters is **Active**; not retroactive.
- **Open lead:** `/partner/login` gets ~3.5x more outreach traffic than `/partner/signup` — prospects
  hitting login instead of signup. Likely CTA ambiguity. Worth investigating (easy conversion win).

### 4. LinkedIn outreach — playbook delivered (no code)
Free-tier LinkedIn is a better channel than cold email (personal + human, no bots). Delivered a Word
playbook (strategy, free-tier limits, connection-note + follow-up templates EN/ES, tracked-link setup).
Marketing guy runs it from HIS OWN profile as "[Name] from Camel Global". Tracked link:
`https://portal.camel-global.com/partner/signup?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=founding-partner`
(shows as source=linkedin in GA4). Sales Navigator: 100 connects/week cap (same as free), no API/export,
don't use automation tools. Note: playbook link points at /partner/signup — user may prefer homepage `/`.

---

### 5. VEHICLE PREFERENCES feature (transmission + child seats) — ~60% SHIPPED
Customer picks transmission (auto/manual/no-pref) + child seats (infant/toddler/booster quantities) at
booking. **Informational only — deliberately NOT part of matching** (match loop untouched; it filters on
category + passengers + suitcases + hand_luggage + radius only). A/C dropped (all cars have it).

**DB (done):** 4 nullable columns added via Supabase SQL:
`customer_requests.pref_transmission text`, `.pref_child_seats jsonb`,
`partner_bookings.pref_transmission text`, `.pref_child_seats jsonb`.
`pref_child_seats` shape: `{"infant":1,"toddler":0,"booster":2}` or null. Transmission: 'automatic'|'manual'|null.

**SHIPPED surfaces:**
- DONE Homepage booking form (`camel-customer/app/page.tsx`) — new row above Main Driver Age: Transmission
  select + 3 child-seat quantity selects. State + POST body.
- DONE Request-save route (`camel-customer/app/api/test-booking/requests/route.ts`) — parses + inserts prefs
  + added to GET select. **LESSON re-learned: form sending a field != saved; the route must parse it from
  body AND add to the insert. First attempt saved NULL because route wasn't updated (Phase 2b was skipped).**
- DONE Partner request view (`camel-portal/app/partner/requests/[id]/page.tsx` + its API route
  `app/api/partner/requests/[id]/route.ts` select) — shows Transmission + Child seats rows. Portal 6-locale
  keys `requests.detail.info.transmission.*` / `.childSeats.*`. Verified live on #1000173.
- DONE Customer booking detail (`camel-customer/app/bookings/[id]/page.tsx` + its API route
  `app/api/test-booking/requests/[id]/route.ts` select) — shows both rows. Verified live on #1000173.

**i18n:** customer keys `home.transmission.*`, `home.childSeats.*` (+ `.infantWord/.toddlerWord/.boosterWord`
lowercase for inline values) in all 6 customer locales. Portal keys as above.

**Display format everywhere:** transmission -> "Automatic"/"Manual" or "-"; child seats -> only types >0,
e.g. "1 infant, 1 toddler, 1 booster", "-" if none.

**REMAINING (do next chat) — the 3 document surfaces, all via the Stripe webhook:**
1. **Stripe webhook** `camel-customer/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`:
   - add `pref_transmission, pref_child_seats` to the `customer_requests` select (~line 235)
   - add them to the `partner_bookings` insert (~line 253)
   - pass them into `sendBookingReceiptEmail(...)` params (~line 383)
2. **Receipt PDF** `camel-customer/lib/portal/generateBookingReceiptPDF.tsx`:
   - add the 2 fields to BOTH type blocks (~126-140 and ~372-384) + param mapping (~420)
   - render 2 display rows near passengers/suitcases (~237-246) — **PDF STAYS ENGLISH** (NTUK rule)
   - add to the email HTML — **email IS localised** per communication_locale (6 locales, EN fallback)
3. **Completion PDF** `camel-customer/lib/portal/generateCompletionStatementPDF.tsx` — same pattern,
   **English only** (user confirmed: confirmation PDF AND completion PDF stay English).
   NB: user explicitly said BOTH PDFs stay English; only the email body is localised.

Method to reuse: pure-ASCII `python3 << 'PYEOF'` heredocs, backup + anchor-count assert + abort on
mismatch, `npx tsc --noEmit` before each deploy, deploy per logical unit, verify live. Always add the
column to the `.select()` of whatever route feeds a page — that bit tripped us up 3x. Backups this
session: `*.chat57*.bak` (gitignored; sweep when convenient).

---

### Housekeeping / carried forward
- Existing real partners (Berrocar, Kingsman) are `approved` not matchable-live — but per the enum
  investigation above, sort out what "live/matchable" actually means BEFORE trying to make them live.
- Kingsman fleet showed `is_active=false` — may need reactivating for AU (blocked on Global Payouts anyway).
- Still open from Chat 56: Stripe Global Payouts AU/NZ (blocked on Stripe Sales); German-email live test;
  partner new-request alert live test; middleware auth gate; commission-invoice VAT; Xero; US-market items.
- `/partner/login` >> `/partner/signup` outreach traffic — investigate (CTA ambiguity, likely quick win).

### NEXT CHAT — suggested order
1. Tag `v-stable-chat57` both repos.
2. **Investigate the `status==="live"` match-loop question** (section 1 open question) — this may be a real
   production bug (real partners never matching). Read the actual code, don't assume. Highest priority.
3. Finish vehicle preferences: the 3 document surfaces (webhook + 2 PDFs + localised email) — section 5.
4. If time: the `/partner/login` vs `/partner/signup` CTA leak.

## Chat 58 — Vehicle preferences: document surfaces completed [Jul 6 2026]

Finished the transmission + child-seats feature that was ~60% done at end of Chat 57.
The interactive path (form → DB → partner request view → customer booking page) was
already live and verified on #1000173. This session added the three document surfaces,
all threaded off the Stripe payment webhook. camel-customer only; portal untouched.

Shipped (5 commits, all on origin/main, tsc clean, per-unit commits):
- 81f9422 webhook (app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts): added pref_transmission,
  pref_child_seats to the customer_requests select; store both on the partner_bookings
  insert; pass both into sendBookingReceiptEmail. No charge/transfer/fee/currency logic
  touched — purely additive plumbing of two nullable columns.
- fac077c receipt PDF (lib/portal/generateBookingReceiptPDF.tsx): transmissionLabel +
  childSeatsLabel helpers; widened ReceiptData + GenerateBookingReceiptParams; param
  mapping; two rows in Journey Details (under Additional drivers). PDF ENGLISH (NTUK rule).
- 249479d receipt email (same file): RC_PREF 6-locale map + conditional prefsBlock in the
  email HTML. Block is OMITTED entirely when no transmission chosen AND all seat counts 0
  (no empty box). Localised per communication_locale, EN fallback.
- 767d325 completion PDF (lib/portal/generateCompletionStatementPDF.tsx): same two helpers;
  widened CompletionStatementParams; two rows in Booking Details (before Settlement
  currency). ENGLISH.
- 1b69b13 completion route (app/api/test-booking/bookings/[id]/completion-statement/route.ts):
  added the two columns to the partner_bookings select; passes them in as
  (bk as any).pref_* ?? null (cast avoids needing regenerated Supabase types).

Display format (matches request/booking pages): transmission -> "Automatic"/"Manual"/"-";
child seats -> only types >0, e.g. "1 infant, 1 toddler, 1 booster", else "-".

DB (done in Chat 57): customer_requests.pref_transmission text, .pref_child_seats jsonb;
partner_bookings.pref_transmission text, .pref_child_seats jsonb. Shape:
{"infant":1,"toddler":0,"booster":2} or null.

Method: pure-ASCII python3 heredocs (accents \u-escaped), backup + count==1 assert +
abort, tsc after each pair. Cross-file chicken-and-egg hit again (webhook sent the new
props before the receipt type declared them — TS2353 until both applied; tsc once, on the
pair). Backups: *.chat58.*.bak (gitignored).

### VERIFY (not yet done — live payment-triggered):
- [ ] Booking through payment WITH prefs: confirmation email shows prefs in customer's
      language + receipt PDF shows them (English).
- [ ] Completion statement for that booking: two English rows in Booking Details.
- [ ] Empty case (customer chose nothing): PDFs show "-"; email prefs block ABSENT (no box).

## Chat 58 — Vehicle preferences complete + status="live" matching regression FIXED [Jul 6 2026]

Two things this session. Recommend tagging v-stable-chat58 on BOTH repos after the
vehicle-prefs live test passes.

### 1. Vehicle preferences (transmission + child seats) — COMPLETE
Finished the ~60% feature from Chat 57. Added the three document surfaces off the Stripe
webhook. camel-customer only. 5 commits, all on origin/main, tsc clean:
- 81f9422 webhook: store pref_transmission/pref_child_seats on partner_bookings; pass to
  receipt generator. No charge/transfer/fee/currency logic touched.
- fac077c receipt PDF: two rows in Journey Details (ENGLISH, NTUK rule).
- 249479d receipt email: RC_PREF 6-locale map + conditional prefsBlock (localised; block
  OMITTED entirely when nothing chosen — no empty box).
- 767d325 completion PDF: two rows in Booking Details (ENGLISH).
- 1b69b13 completion route: read the two cols off partner_bookings, pass them in.
Display format: transmission -> "Automatic"/"Manual"/"-"; child seats -> types >0 only,
e.g. "1 infant, 1 toddler, 1 booster", else "-".
DB cols (Chat 57): customer_requests + partner_bookings .pref_transmission text,
.pref_child_seats jsonb ({"infant":n,"toddler":n,"booster":n} or null).
STILL TO VERIFY: live payment run (locale=de booking -> German email + English PDF; empty case).

### 2. status="live" matching regression — ROOT-CAUSED and FIXED (was the top carry-forward)
THE CORRECT MODEL (write this down, do not re-break): partner_applications.status is ONLY
pending / approved / rejected. "live" / "matchable" is a COMPUTED concept — the 8 checks in
camel-portal/lib/portal/refreshPartnerLiveStatus.ts (service_radius_km>0, base_address,
base_lat, base_lng, active fleet, active driver, default_currency, vat_number). The admin
"Live Profile" badge is computed from these; it never read status. A partner matches when
APPROVED **and** live-ready. status is NEVER "live".

Root cause: Chat 55 commit 065b8de ("email live in-radius partners on new request") ADDED a
gate `partner_applications.status === "live"` to the customer match loop — before that commit
there was NO status gate at all. "live" was never a real status value, so the loop silently
matched NOBODY. Chat 57 misdiagnosed a no-match as a missing enum value, added 'live' to the
enum + flipped Test Cars, which cascaded into make-live/refreshPartnerLiveStatus writing
status="live" and polluting Kingsman's Status badge. (The Chat 57 "correct model" note was
right about the model but wrong to conclude the fix was done — the regression was still live.)

Fix (2 commits + 1 SQL):
- camel-customer 5effa55 (app/api/test-booking/requests/route.ts): match gate is now
  APPROVED + full live-readiness (active driver + base_address + default_currency +
  vat_number; fleet-in-category/coords/radius already ensured earlier in the loop). Pulled
  the 3 extra profile fields into the select. Comment corrected.
- camel-portal 20065cc (refreshPartnerLiveStatus.ts + make-live/route.ts): REMOVED the
  status:"live" writes; keep stamping live_email_sent_at (that's what does email de-dup).
  make-live's `currentStatus === "live"` guards are now dead branches — harmless, left as-is.
- Supabase SQL (run AFTER both deploys): UPDATE partner_applications SET status='approved'
  WHERE status='live';  -> flipped Kingsman back to approved.
Deploy order that matters: customer match-loop FIRST, then portal, then SQL last (else a
live row matches nothing in the gap).
The inert 'live' enum label remains (Postgres can't easily drop it) — unused, do not write it.

VERIFIED IN PRODUCTION: no rows with status='live'; all partners approved/pending; a new
in-radius request matched Test Cars (approved + live-ready) with match_status="open".
Kingsman = approved + Not live (fleet is_active=false) -> correctly does not match.

### Still open (carried forward)
- Vehicle-prefs live payment test (above).
- Kingsman fleet is_active=false — reactivate for AU when Global Payouts lands.
- Global Payouts AU/NZ (blocked on Stripe Sales); live German-email test; /partner/login vs
  /partner/signup CTA leak; middleware auth gate; commission-invoice VAT; Xero; US-market.

> **SUPERSEDED by Chat 59 (Jul 8 2026).** The 0.25% cross-border fee below is WRONG for AU/NZ (real: AU ~1-3%, NZ ~0.5-2.5% depending on FX). See the Chat 59 Global Payouts section for corrected fees, all answered Stripe questions, and the full build plan.

## Chat 58 — Global Payouts AU/NZ: questions ANSWERED, project scoped (not started) [Jul 6 2026]

Supersedes the Chat 56 "Stripe corridor reality" + "5 questions pending" blocks — Stripe has
now answered all five. AU/NZ payouts are a SEPARATE PARALLEL PIPELINE, not a variant of the
existing destination-charge flow. NOTHING BUILT YET. Awaiting direct-email assistance from
Stripe (requested this session) on commercial terms + formal AU/NZ activation before build.

### Status of access
- Global Payouts SETTINGS are accessible on the platform account (Camel Global Ltd) — feature
  appears enabled, but NOT configured: both payout methods (Standard 2-3 days, Instant 30 min)
  were toggled OFF in the dashboard. Nothing can move until at least Standard (local bank) is ON.
- A support-channel mismatch happened first: the request came from a different Stripe account/
  email (acct_1TpCHX...) than the platform account it's for (acct_1TggMl...); Stripe declined to
  action cross-account for security and told us to enable from the dashboard while logged into the
  correct account (done) OR re-submit signed in as the platform account's email. Step 1 worked.
- GATING (Stripe-side, not code): (a) confirm FORMAL AU/NZ recipient activation (may need
  Enhanced Due Diligence, 2-3 wks), (b) enable a payout method on the settings page, (c) direct-
  email assistance requested for commercial terms/minimums/timeline — answers drive the batching
  decision below. CONFIRM the Global-Payouts-enabled account is the SAME account the live
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY points at (the mismatch above is exactly this risk).

### The 5 questions — ANSWERED by Stripe
1. Access: UK platform CAN send to AU/NZ via Global Payouts (limited public preview). Formal
   activation = identity verification + due-diligence questionnaire, a few business days.
2. Recipient model: MUST create SEPARATE recipient objects (v2 Accounts API,
   configuration.recipient). Existing Express Connect accounts CANNOT be reused. Cross-border
   Connect (the 0.25% product) only works US/UK/EEA/Canada/Switzerland — NOT AU/NZ. Recipient-
   service-agreement accounts can't receive cross-border Connect payouts.
3. Onboarding data for AU/NZ recipients: identity (name, email, country, entity type, legal
   business name), full address, bank details (BSB+account for AU; NZ account format), + method-
   specific fields. Exact requirements returned DYNAMICALLY via requirements.entries in the
   Accounts API response when you request capabilities.
4. Payout methods AU/NZ: LOCAL BANK TRANSFER (preferred, cheapest — enable
   configuration.recipient.capabilities.bank_accounts.local), wire (pricier), instant debit-card
   (Visa Direct/Mastercard Send, needs card + DOB). Use local bank.
5. Charge/payout flow + FX: FLOW CHANGES. NOT destination charges. Customer pays -> funds settle
   to PLATFORM BALANCE -> create explicit OutboundPayment per booking, each preceded by an
   OutboundPaymentQuote (FX rate + fees). Cross-border FX fees apply; local bank AU/NZ ~1-3 biz
   days. THERE ARE PER-TRANSACTION MINIMUMS — for small per-booking amounts Stripe advises
   BATCHING multiple bookings into one payout for the economics. (This is the key commercial
   unknown the direct-email thread must pin down.)

### Build plan (its own multi-session project — do NOT start at session end)
Diverges by partner country (same decision point as stripeCountry()). Touches the most sensitive
files (create-intent, webhook) — same discipline as the payment work this session.
- PHASE 1 Onboarding fork: AU/NZ partners -> create a Global Payouts RECIPIENT (v2 Accounts API,
  configuration.recipient, local bank capability) instead of an Express Connect account. Collect
  BSB/account/address/entity dynamically from requirements.entries.
- PHASE 2 Charge fork: AU/NZ bookings must NOT use transfer_data.destination. Charge to platform
  balance. Touches create-intent + webhooks/stripe. In-corridor (EUR/GBP/USD/CAD) stays unchanged.
- PHASE 3 Payout pipeline: OutboundPaymentQuote -> OutboundPayment per booking (or per batch),
  reconciled against existing payout_status / payout_batch_id columns. DECIDE batching (per-booking
  vs accumulate to clear minimums) from Stripe's commercial answers.
- PHASE 4 Cron: monthly-payout cron assumes in-corridor destination transfers; add an AU/NZ branch
  that runs OutboundPayments (respecting batching).

### Kingsman implication (IMPORTANT — decision made this session)
Kingsman (AU) is INTENTIONALLY left fully live/matchable (approved + all 8 live checks pass:
fleet 2, driver 1, base_lat/lng, radius 300km, AUD, vat TFN588257928). It WILL match in-radius
Adelaide requests, get the new-request email, bid and win. Customer CHARGE works. But there is NO
automated payout path — AU is out-of-corridor and the Global Payouts pipeline above is NOT built.
Any completed Kingsman booking must be settled MANUALLY (dashboard OutboundPayment) until Phase 3
ships; do NOT expect the auto destination-transfer to fire (it can't reach AU). Also: Chat 56 left
Kingsman stripe_account_id NULL after deleting its wrong-country Spanish acct — but note the new
model means AU partners need a RECIPIENT object, not a Connect account, so the reconnect approach
itself changes under Phase 1. Confirm what Kingsman actually has before relying on it.
Kingsman user_id: 116fd343-a034-4153-ac33-34bf1fcd7153.
- Global Payouts AU/NZ: 5 questions ANSWERED (see Chat 58 section). Awaiting Stripe direct-email
  on commercial terms + formal AU/NZ activation. Then build as a 4-phase project (recipient
  onboarding fork, platform-balance charge fork, OutboundPayment pipeline w/ batching, cron
  branch). Enable a payout method (Standard/local bank) in the dashboard first. Kingsman is live
  but UNPAYABLE until this ships — settle any AU booking manually.

## Chat 59 — Global Payouts AU/NZ: fully scoped, unblocked, ready to build [Jul 8 2026]

SUPERSEDES the Chat 56 "Stripe corridor reality" + Chat 58 "questions ANSWERED" blocks. Stripe has now answered ALL questions (both rounds). The fee numbers below OVERRIDE the "0.25%" figure from Chat 56/58 — that was WRONG for AU/NZ. Nothing built yet; project is fully unblocked (only remaining external steps are two dashboard toggles Nick does himself). Tag v-stable-chat59 on BOTH repos before Phase 1.

### Headline model
- In-corridor partners (EUR/GBP/USD/CAD — UK, EEA, US, Canada, Switzerland): stay on EXISTING flow — Express Connect + destination charges. Do NOT touch.
- AU/NZ: OUT of corridor → separate parallel pipeline (Global Payouts). Country fork at the same point as stripeCountry() in app/api/partner/stripe/connect/route.ts.

### Answers from Stripe (all confirmed)
1. ACCOUNT CONFIRMED: Global Payouts is on the SAME live account the live secret key uses — Camel Global Ltd, account ID ending cs5n. Before any live payout, verify STRIPE_SECRET_KEY resolves to ...cs5n. (Retires the old acct_1TpCHX vs acct_1TggMl mismatch worry.)
2. DASHBOARD TASK 1 (Nick, no code): Settings → Global Payouts → Payout methods → enable Local network (bank_accounts.local). Nothing pays out until this is on. No extra eligibility/activation gate.
3. Recipient model: AU/NZ MUST be separate recipient objects (v2 Accounts API, configuration.recipient, bank_accounts.local). Express Connect accounts CANNOT be reused. Required fields come back dynamically in requirements.entries — don't hardcode. Stripe-hosted form = least build.
4. Flow: NO destination charges for AU/NZ. Customer pays → charge settles to platform balance → OutboundPaymentQuote (locks FX) → OutboundPayment to recipient local bank. Local bank ~1–7 days.
5. Refunds (RESHAPES REFUND CODE): Global Payouts is decoupled — NO auto transfer reversal. Refund the customer against the charge (debits platform balance) normally, but recovering from the partner is on US (deduct from next payout via ledger, or invoice). Payout in processing = cancelable; posted = final; returned (bad bank details) = auto-returns to financial account.
6. Webhooks: outbound_payment.created / .posted / .failed / .canceled / .returned / .updated. Store booking ID in OutboundPayment metadata for reconciliation.
7. Funding (DASHBOARD TASK 2, Nick, no code): Balances → financial account → Recurring transfers → Automatic, daily, "transfer all revenue". Internal transfers immediate + free; only available/settled funds move (natural T+n lag, pairs with batching).

### Corrected fees (Camel absorbs partner Stripe fees — customer-pays-in-partner-currency exists to avoid FX)
Two cases per AU/NZ payout:
- NO-FX (the intent): hold AUD/NZD in a multi-currency platform balance, pay out SAME-CURRENCY → no 2% FX. Cost = cross-border + £0.50 standard. AU ≈ 1.0% + £0.50; NZ ≈ 0.5% + £0.50.
- WORST CASE (a GBP↔AUD/NZD conversion happens): add 2% FX. AU ≈ 3.0% + £0.50; NZ ≈ 2.5% + £0.50.
CRUX QUESTION (confirm with Stripe / balance settings): does an AUD separate-charge settle AS AUD (multi-currency balance) so we can pay out same-currency and skip the 2% FX? Decides ~1% vs ~3%. Build to hold + pay same-currency regardless; confirm so reported fees/margin are right.
MINIMUM: ~one base unit each currency (≈ A$1/NZ$1). Does NOT force batching — batching only compresses the fixed £0.50, an economics choice not a requirement.

### NEW REQUIREMENT — Camel absorbs ALL Stripe fees → report in admin reports
Capture per booking, forward from Phase 5 go-live (historical backfill optional). Fee types: card processing fee (every booking, from the charge's balance-transaction fee — currently NOT reported) + AU/NZ payout fees (£0.50 + cross-border % + FX % only if conversion). Store partner_bookings.stripe_fee_total numeric + stripe_fee_breakdown jsonb (incl. currency). Reports aggregate per-currency alongside revenue/commission (same CURRENCIES loop); add "Stripe fees (absorbed)" + derived "Camel net margin = commission − fees" + CSV. NEVER sum fees across currencies.

### DB schema (Supabase, additive/nullable)
ALTER TABLE partner_profiles ADD COLUMN stripe_recipient_id text;
ALTER TABLE partner_profiles ADD COLUMN payout_rail text DEFAULT 'connect'; -- 'connect' | 'global_payouts'
ALTER TABLE partner_bookings ADD COLUMN charge_model text DEFAULT 'destination'; -- 'destination' | 'separate'
ALTER TABLE partner_bookings ADD COLUMN outbound_payment_id text;
ALTER TABLE partner_bookings ADD COLUMN outbound_quote_id text;
ALTER TABLE partner_bookings ADD COLUMN stripe_fee_total numeric DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE partner_bookings ADD COLUMN stripe_fee_breakdown jsonb;
CREATE TABLE partner_recovery_ledger (id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(), partner_user_id uuid, booking_id uuid REFERENCES partner_bookings(id), amount numeric NOT NULL, currency text NOT NULL, reason text, status text DEFAULT 'outstanding', created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now());
-- existing payout_status / payout_batch_id reused.

### Build plan (multi-session; test mode end-to-end before real money; pure-ASCII heredocs, backup+assert, tsc, per-unit commits, verify live)
DASHBOARD PRE-WORK (Nick): enable Local network; set up recurring daily transfers; confirm STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = ...cs5n.
- PHASE 1 (portal) Recipient onboarding fork: app/api/partner/stripe/connect/route.ts — base_country ∈ {AU,NZ} → create v2 recipient (write stripe_recipient_id + payout_rail='global_payouts'), else existing Connect. Partner "Connect Stripe" UI (profile/onboarding) branches on payout_rail.
- PHASE 2 (customer) Charge fork: app/api/payments/create-intent/route.ts — payout_rail='global_payouts' → PaymentIntent WITHOUT transfer_data.destination/on_behalf_of, charge_model='separate'; in-corridor unchanged. webhooks/stripe: persist charge_model.
- PHASE 3 (portal+customer) OutboundPayment pipeline + refund fork: Quote→Payment, booking ID in metadata, store outbound_payment_id/quote_id/payout_status/batch_id; webhook handles the 6 events + captures payout fees. Refund fork in completeBooking.tsx + admin/bookings/[id]/post-refund/route.ts — AU/NZ: refund customer + write partner_recovery_ledger row (net commission already taken); in-corridor byte-unchanged.
- PHASE 4 (portal) Cron branch: app/cron/monthly-payout/route.ts — add AU/NZ OutboundPayment branch (respect batching); funding handled by dashboard recurring transfer; guard insufficient balance.
- PHASE 5 (portal) Fee capture + admin reporting: card fee from balance transaction in webhooks/stripe on charge success; payout fees in the OutboundPayment handler; app/admin/reports/page.tsx (+ admin/bookings reporting) per-currency stripe_fee_total accumulator, "Stripe fees (absorbed)" + net-margin line + CSV.
- PHASE 6 Verification: test-mode end-to-end, then a small real AU booking (manual confirm), then refund fork + ledger.

### Kingsman (AU) — carried forward
user_id 116fd343-a034-4153-ac33-34bf1fcd7153. Live/matchable (approved + live checks pass, AUD, 300km Adelaide). Matches/bids/wins and customer CHARGE works, but NO automated payout until Phases 1–4 ship — settle manually (Dashboard OutboundPayment). stripe_account_id NULL (old Spanish acct deleted); under the new model AU needs a RECIPIENT object not a Connect account, so Phase 1 is the reconnect path. Fleet is_active=false — reactivate when going live for AU.

### Blocked vs ready
- READY NOW: Phases 1–2 + Phase 5 card-fee (no external dependency). Do the two dashboard tasks + ...cs5n check first.
- NO EXTERNAL BLOCKER REMAINS (only the two dashboard toggles Nick controls).
- CONFIRM before finalising Phase 2/3 economics: the FX crux question above (~1% vs ~3%). Not a build blocker.
- Batching shape = economics call, pick during Phase 3.
